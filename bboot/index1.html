            <b>NARENDRA MODI</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Narendra Damodardas Modi (Gujarati: [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː]
            (listen); born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician serving
            as the 14th and current Prime Minister of India since 2014. Modi was
            the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of
            Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata
            Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a
            right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He
            is the longest serving prime minister from outside the Indian
            National Congress. Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in
            northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He
            was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about
            helping out after school at his father's tea stall at the Vadnagar
            railway station. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal
            Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged
            her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so
            by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has
            asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after
            leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres,
            but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to
            Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the
            state of emergency was declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in
            1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985
            and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001,
            rising to the rank of general secretary.[c] Modi was appointed Chief
            Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health
            and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was
            elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration
            has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which
            1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[d] or
            otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special
            Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found no
            evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi
            personally.[e] While his policies as chief minister—credited with
            encouraging economic growth—have received praise, his administration
            was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty
            and education indices in the state.[f] Modi led the BJP in the 2014
            general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house
            of Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single
            party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign
            direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on
            healthcare, education, and social welfare programmes. Modi
            centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and
            replacing it with the NITI Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation
            campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of
            high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation
            regime, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He
            oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Prime
            Minister, Modi has received consistently high approval
            ratings.[12][13][14] Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced
            democratic backsliding.[15][16][g] Following his party's victory in
            the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special
            status of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the Citizenship Amendment
            Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread
            protests and sit-ins across the country, resulting in a formal
            repeal of the latter. Described as engineering a political
            realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of
            controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu
            nationalist beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots,
            cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.

          <h4 id="list-item-2"><b>EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</b></h4>
          <p>
            Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati
            Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State
            (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to
            Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi
            (1923–2022).[28][b][29] Modi's family belonged to the
            Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community,[30][31][32] which is
            categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian
            government.[32][33] Modi had only infrequently spoken of his family
            background during his 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat. In the
            run up to the 2014 national elections, he began to regularly draw
            attention to his low-ranking social origins and to having to work as
            a child in his father's tea shop on the Vadnagar railway station
            platform,[34] a description that the evidence of neighbours does not
            entirely corroborate.[35][36] Modi completed his higher secondary
            education in Vadnagar in 1967, where teachers described him as an
            average student and a keen gifted debater, with interest in
            theatre.[37] Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in
            theatrical productions, which has influenced his political
            image.[38][39] When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the
            Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local
            shakhas (training sessions). There, Modi met Lakshmanrao Inamdar,
            popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a balswayamsevak
            (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[40] While
            Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar
            and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who were founding
            members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.[41] In a custom
            traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a
            betrothal to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their
            marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[42][43] Soon afterwards, he
            abandoned his bride,[44] and left home, never divorcing her, but the
            marriage remaining unmentioned in Modi's public pronouncements for
            many decades.[45] In April 2014, shortly before the national
            elections that swept him to power, Modi publicly affirmed that he
            was married and his spouse was Jashodaben; the couple has remained
            married, but estranged.[46] Reportedly, their marriage was never
            consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not
            have become a pracharak in the puritan Rashtriya Swayamsevak
            Sangh.[47][48] Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across
            Northern and North-eastern India, though few details of where he
            went have emerged.[49] In interviews, Modi has described visiting
            Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near
            Kolkata, followed by the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the
            Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. Modi remained only a short time at
            each, since he lacked the required college education.[50]
            Vivekananda has been described as a large influence in Modi's
            life.[51] In the early summer of 1968, Modi reached the Belur Math
            but was turned away, after which Modi wandered through Calcutta,
            West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. Modi then
            went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again
            rejected, before travelling back to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan
            in 1968–69. Sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, Modi returned to
            Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for
            Ahmedabad.[52][53] There, Modi lived with his uncle, working in the
            latter's canteen at the Gujarat State Road Transport
            Corporation.[54] In Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with
            Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in
            the city.[55][56][57] Modi's first known political activity as an
            adult was in 1971 when he, as per his remarks, joined a Jana Sangh
            Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist for the
            battlefield during the Bangladesh Liberation War.[58][59] The Indira
            Gandhi-led central government disallowed open support for the Mukti
            Bahini, and Modi says he was put in Tihar Jail for a short
            period.[60][61][62] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, he stopped
            working for his uncle and became a full-time pracharak (campaigner)
            for the RSS,[63] working under Inamdar.[64] Shortly before the war,
            Modi took part in a non-violent protest against the Indian
            government in New Delhi, for which he was arrested (as per his
            claim); this has been cited as a reason for Inamdar electing to
            mentor him.[64] Many years later Modi would co-author a biography of
            Inamdar, published in 2001.[65] Modi's claim that he was part of a
            Satyagraha led to a political war.[61] Applications were filed with
            the PMO under the RTI Act seeking details of his arrest. In reply,
            the PMO claimed that it maintains official records on Modi only
            since he took charge as the Prime Minister of India in 2014. Despite
            this claim, the official website of the PMO contains specific
            information about Modi which dates back to the 1950s.[66][67] In
            1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science
            from the School of Open Learning (SOL)[68] at the University of
            Delhi,[47] graduating with a third class.[69] Five years later, in
            1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from
            Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[70][71] as an
            external distance learning student.[72] There is a controversy
            surrounding his educational qualification.[73][74] Replying to an
            RTI query, the SOL said it did not have any data of students who
            received a BA degree in 1978.[68] Jayantibhai Patel, a former
            political science professor of Gujarat University, claimed that the
            subjects listed in Modi's MA degree were not offered by the
            university when Modi was studying there.

          <h4 id="list-item-3"><b> EARLY POLITICAL CAREER</b></h4>
          <p>
            In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of
            emergency in India which lasted until 1977. During this period,
            known as "The Emergency", many of her political opponents were
            jailed and opposition groups were banned.[77][78] Modi was appointed
            general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS
            committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat.
            Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[79] Modi was forced to go
            underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid
            arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the
            government, sending them to Delhi and organising
            demonstrations.[80][81] Modi was also involved with creating a
            network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and
            in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[82] During
            this period, Modi wrote a book in Gujarati, Sangharsh Ma Gujarat (In
            The Struggles of Gujarat), describing events during the
            Emergency.[83][84] Among the people he met in this role was trade
            unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes, as well as several
            other national political figures.[85] In his travels during the
            Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing
            as a monk, and once as a Sikh.[86] Modi became an RSS sambhag
            pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in
            the areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the
            RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the
            RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to
            Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP
            in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the
            Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's
            planning has been described as the reason for that result by
            biographers.[87][88] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP
            in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions
            within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his
            selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary
            of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[89] Modi with Atal Bihari
            Vajpayee in c. 2001 Modi rose within the party and was named a
            member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping
            organise L. K. Advani's 1990 Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli
            Manohar Joshi's 1991–92 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).[37][90][91]
            However, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead
            establishing a school in Ahmedabad; friction with Shankersinh
            Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat at the time, also played a part in
            this decision.[91] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994,
            partly at the insistence of Advani, and as party secretary, Modi's
            electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the
            1995 state assembly elections.[92][93] In November of that year Modi
            was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi,
            where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and
            Himachal Pradesh.[94] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a
            prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National
            Congress (Congress, INC) after losing his parliamentary seat in the
            Lok Sabha elections.[37] Modi, on the selection committee for the
            1998 Assembly elections in Gujarat, favoured supporters of BJP
            leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end
            factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as key to
            the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections,[95] and
            Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of
            that year
          </p>
          <h4 id="list-item-4"><b>CHEIF MINISTER OF GUJRAT</b></h4>
          <p>
            In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few
            state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power,
            corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing
            had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake
            in Bhuj in 2001.[95][97][98] The BJP national leadership sought a
            new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had
            expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a
            replacement.[37] Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to
            ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in
            government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief
            minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was "going
            to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all". On 3 October
            2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the
            responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002
            elections.[99] Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October
            2001,[100] and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February
            2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot – II constituency,
            defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.
