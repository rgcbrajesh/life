            <b>Yogi Adityanath</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Yogi Adityanath (born Ajay Singh Bisht; 5 June 1972),[6][1][7][a][9]
            is an Indian Hindu monk and politician who is serving as the 21st
            and current Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, since 19 March 2017. A
            member of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the RSS, Adityanath is
            known for being on the far right of Indian politics.[10][11] He was
            appointed the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on 26 March 2017 after
            the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the 2017 State Assembly
            elections in which he was a prominent campaigner.[12][13][14] The
            BJP also won the 2022 State Assembly elections: Adityanath continued
            as Chief Minister, becoming the first chief minister of Uttar
            Pradesh to return to power after completing a 5-year term in office.
            Currently, he is the member of legislative assembly from Gorakhpur
            Urban for the second term as a chief minister (from 2022). He
            contested the 2022 state assembly election from Gorakhpur urban and
            won with huge margin of votes. Adityanath previously was the member
            of legislative council during his first tenure as chief minister
            (2017-2022). He resigned from the legislative council after being
            elected to the legislative assembly. He is a former Member of
            Parliament, Lok Sabha from Gorakhpur constituency, Uttar Pradesh,
            for five consecutive terms from 1998 to 2017 before he resigned to
            become the Chief Minister.[15] Adityanath is also the mahant (Head
            Priest) of the Gorakhnath Math, a Hindu monastery in Gorakhpur, a
            position he has held since September 2014 following the death of
            Mahant Avaidyanath, his spiritual "father".[16] He is also the
            founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini, a Hindu nationalist
            organisation.[17][18] He has an image of a Hindutva nationalist and
            a social conservative
          </p>
          <h4 id="list-item-2"><b>EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</b></h4>
          <p>
            Yogi Adityanath was born as Ajay Mohan Singh Bisht on 5 June 1972 in
            the village of Panchur, in Pauri Garhwal, Uttar Pradesh (now in
            Uttarakhand) in a Rajput family.[1][7][23][24][25] His late father,
            Anand Singh Bisht, was a forest ranger.[b] He was the second born in
            the family, among four brothers and three sisters.[28] He completed
            his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Hemwati Nandan
            Bahuguna Garhwal University in Uttarakhand.[29][30] He left his home
            around the 1990s to join the Ayodhya Ram temple movement. Around
            that time, he also became a disciple of Mahant Avaidyanath, the
            chief of the Gorakhnath Math.[29] Mahant Avaidyanath was leading the
            Ayodhya Ram temple movement at that time. While based in Gorakhpur
            after his initiation, Adityanath has often visited his ancestral
            village, establishing a school there in 1998.[28] Adityanath was
            promoted to the rank of Mahant or high priest of the Gorakhnath Math
            after the death of Avaidyanath on 12 September 2014. He was made
            Peethadhishwar (Head Seer) of the Math amid traditional rituals of
            the Nath sect two days later.
          </p>
          <h4 id="list-item-3"><b> Early political career</b></h4>
          <p>
            Yogi Adityanath belongs to a specific tradition of Hindutva politics
            in Uttar Pradesh that can be traced back to the Mahant Digvijay
            Nath, who led the placing of idols in the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on
            22 December 1949.[32][33] Both Digvijay Nath and his successor
            Avaidyanath belonged to the Hindu Mahasabha and were elected to the
            Parliament on that party's ticket. After the BJP and the Sangh
            Parivar joined the Ayodhya movement in the 1980s, the two strands of
            Hindu nationalism came together. Avaidyanath switched to the BJP in
            1991, but nevertheless maintained significant autonomy. Four years
            after Adityanath was designated Avaidyanath's successor, he was
            elected to the Lower House of the Indian Parliament (the Lok
            Sabha).[32] After his first electoral win, Adityanath started his
            own youth organisation Hindu Yuva Vahini, which came to be known for
            its activities in the eastern Uttar Pradesh and was instrumental in
            Adityanath's meteoric rise. There have been recurrent tensions
            between Adityanath and the BJP leadership over the allocation of
            election tickets. However, the BJP has not let the tensions mount
            because Adityanath has served as a star campaigner for the
            party.[32][34][35] In 2006, he took up links between Nepali Maoists
            and Indian Leftist parties as a key campaign issue and encouraged
            Madhesi leaders to oppose Maoism in Nepal.[17][36] In 2008, his
            convoy was reportedly attacked while en route to Azamgarh for an
            anti-terrorism rally. The attack left one person dead and at least
            six persons injured.[37][38] In January 2007, Adityanath with other
            BJP leaders had gathered to mourn the death of a man who was killed
            because of religious violence. He and his supporters were
            subsequently arrested by the police and lodged in Gorkhapur jail on
            the charges of disturbing peace and violating prohibitory orders.
            His arrest led to further unrest during which several coaches of the
            Mumbai bound Mumbai-Gorakhpur Godan Express were burnt, allegedly by
            protesting Hindu Yuva Vahini activists.[39][40][41] The day after
            the arrest, the District Magistrate and the local police chief were
            transferred and replaced.[
          </p>
          <h4 id="list-item-4"><b>Relations with the BJP</b></h4>
          <p>
            Adityanath has had strained relations with the BJP for more than a
            decade.[45] He often derided and undermined the BJP, criticising its
            dilution of the Hindutva ideology.[46] Having established his own
            independent power base in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, with the support of
            the Hindu Yuva Vahini and the Gorakhnath Math, he felt confident to
            be able to dictate terms to the BJP. When his voice was not heard,
            he revolted by fielding candidates against the official BJP
            candidates. The most prominent example was the fielding of Radha
            Mohan Das Agarwal from Gorakhpur on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket in
            2002, who then defeated BJP Cabinet minister, Shiv Pratap Shukla by
            a wide margin.[46] In 2007, Adityanath threatened to field 70
            candidates for the state assembly against the BJP candidates. But he
            reached a compromise in the end.[47][48][49] In 2009 Parliamentary
            elections, Adityanath was rumoured to have campaigned against the
            BJP candidates who were then defeated.[46] Despite his periodic
            revolts, Yogi Adityanath has been kept in good humour by the RSS and
            the BJP leaders. The deputy prime minister L. K. Advani, the RSS
            chief Rajendra Singh and the VHP chief Ashok Singhal have visited
            him in Gorakhpur. During 22–24 December 2006, Adityanath organised a
            three-day Virat Hindu Mahasammelan at Gorakhpur at the same time as
            the BJP National Executive Meet in Lucknow. Despite the conflict,
            several RSS and VHP leaders attended the Mahasammelan, which issued
            a commitment to pursue the Hindutva goals despite the BJP's claimed
            "abandonment" of them.[46][50] In March 2010, Adityanath was one of
            the several BJP MPs who defied the party whip on the Women's
            Reservation Bill in the Parliament.[51][52] In 2018, he campaigned
            for BJP candidate Pratap Puriji Maharaj for Rajasthan state assembly
            election
            <h3><b>Chief Minister of UP</b> </h3>
            Adityanath was a prominent campaigner for the BJP in the 2017 assembly elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The state government appointed him Chief Minister on 18 March 2017;[54] he was sworn in the next day, after the BJP won the assembly elections
