            <b>Amitabh Bachchan</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Amitabh Bachchan (pronounced [əmɪˈt̪ɑːbʱ ˈbətːʃən]; born as Amitabh
            Shrivastav;[1] 11 October 1942[7]) is an Indian actor, film
            producer, television host, occasional playback singer and former
            politician known for his work in Hindi cinema. He is regarded as one
            of the most successful and influential actors in the history of
            Indian cinema.[8] Referred to as the Shahenshah of Bollywood (in
            reference to his 1988 film Shahenshah), Sadi ka Mahanayak (Hindi
            for, "Greatest actor of the century"), Star of the Millennium, or
            Big B.[9] His dominance in the Indian movie scene during the
            1970s–1980s made the French director François Truffaut call it a
            "one-man industry".[10] Bachchan was born in 1942 in Allahabad to
            the Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and his wife, the social
            activist Teji Bachchan. He was educated at Sherwood College,
            Nainital, and Kirori Mal College, University of Delhi. His film
            career started in 1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen's film
            Bhuvan Shome. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for
            films such as Zanjeer, Deewaar and Sholay, and achieved greater
            stardom in later years, dubbed India's "angry young man" for some
            several of his on-screen roles in Hindi films. He has since appeared
            in over 200 Indian films in a career spanning more than five
            decades,[11] He has won numerous accolades in his career, including
            four National Film Awards as Best Actor, Dadasaheb Phalke Award as
            lifetime achievement award and many awards at international film
            festivals and award ceremonies. He has won sixteen Filmfare Awards
            and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at
            Filmfare, with 42 nominations overall. In addition to acting,
            Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and
            television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show
            Kaun Banega Crorepati, India's version of the game show franchise,
            Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. He also entered politics for a time
            in the 1980s. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma
            Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in
            2015 for his contributions to the arts. The Government of France
            honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Knight of the Legion
            of honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema
            and beyond. Bachchan also made an appearance in a Hollywood film,
            Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby (2013), in which he played a
            non-Indian Jewish character, Meyer Wolfsheim. Beyond the Indian
            subcontinent, he acquired a large overseas following of the South
            Asian diaspora, as well as others, in markets including Africa
            (South Africa, Eastern Africa and Mauritius), the Middle East
            (especially UAE and Egypt), the United Kingdom, Russia, Central
            Asia, the Caribbean (Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago),
            Oceania (Fiji, Australia, and New Zealand), Canada and the United
            States

          <p>
            Bachchan was born on 11 October 1942 in Allahabad to the Hindi poet
            Harivansh Rai Bachchan, and social activist Teji Bachchan.[13]
            Harivansh Rai Bachchan was an Awadhi Hindu Kayastha,[14] who was
            fluent in Awadhi,[15] Hindi and Urdu.[16] Harivansh's ancestors came
            from a village called Babupatti, in the Raniganj tehsil, in the
            Pratapgarh district, in the present-day state of Uttar Pradesh, in
            India.[17] Teji Bachchan was a Punjabi Sikh Khatri from Lyallpur,
            Punjab, British India (present-day Faisalabad, Punjab,
            Pakistan).[15][18] Bachchan has a younger brother, Ajitabh, he is 5
            years younger than him.[19] Bachchan's parents were initially going
            to name him Inquilaab (Hindustani for "Revolution"), inspired by the
            phrase Inquilab Zindabad (which translates into English as "Long
            live the revolution") popularly used during the Indian independence
            struggle; the name Amitabh was suggested to his father by poet
            Sumitranandan Pant.[20][1] Although his surname was Shrivastava,
            Amitabh's father, who opposed the caste system, had adopted the pen
            name Bachchan ("child-like" in colloquial Hindi), under which he
            published all of his works.[21] When his father was looking to get
            him admitted to a school, he and Bachchan's mother decided the
            family's name should be Bachchan instead of Shrivastava.[22] It is
            with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and used for all
            other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of
            his immediate family.[23] Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his
            mother in 2007.[24] Bachchan's secondary education was at Boys' High
            School & College in Allahabad and Sherwood College in Nainital. He
            attended Kirori Mal College at the University of Delhi in
            Delhi.[25][26] He graduated with Bachelor of Science degree from
            Kirori Mal College in 1962.[27][28][29] When Bachchan finished his
            studies his father approached Prithviraj Kapoor, the founder of
            Prithvi Theatre and patriarch of the Kapoor acting family, to see if
            there was an opening for him, but Kapoor offered no
            encouragement.[30] Bachchan was a friend of Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay
            Gandhi, before he became an actor. He used to spend time with them
            when he was a resident in New Delhi. Bachchan's family were very
            close to the Nehru-Gandhi family of politicians. When Sonia Gandhi
            first came to India from Italy before her marriage, Bachchan had
            received her at the Palam International Airport on 13 January 1968.
            She spent 48 days at Bachchan's house with his parents before
            marriage. Indira Gandhi wanted his future daughter-in-law to learn
            Hindu customs, way from Bachchan family and she did not think its
            appropriate to keep daughter-in-law in house before marriage. She
            trusted Bachchans and decided to keep Sonia at their house.[31]
            Bachchan applied for a role as a newsreader for All India Radio,
            Delhi but "failed the audition".[30][when?] He became a business
            executive for Bird & Company in Kolkata (Calcutta),[30][when?]and
            worked in the theatre before starting his film career.[32] It is
            thought that his mother might have had some influence in Amitabh
            Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he
            should "take centre stage

          <h4 id="list-item-3"><b> EARLY CAREER</b></h4>
          <p>
            Bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in Mrinal
            Sen's National Award-winning film Bhuvan Shome.[34] His first acting
            role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film Saat
            Hindustani,[35] directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and featuring Utpal
            Dutt, Anwar Ali (brother of comedian Mehmood), Madhu and Jalal
            Agha.[36][37] Anand (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred
            alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of
            life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting
            Actor. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated
            lover-turned-murderer in Parwana (1971). Following Parwana were
            several films including Reshma Aur Shera (1971). During this time,
            he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his
            future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film Bawarchi. In
            1972, he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa
            directed by S. Ramanathan which was moderately successful.[38][39]
            Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do
            well.[40] His only film with Mala Sinha, Sanjog (1972) was also a
            box office failure.n 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres,
            from the comedy Chupke Chupke and the crime drama Faraar to the
            romantic drama Mili. This was also the year in which Bachchan
            starred in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history,
            both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting
            Bachchan.[45] The first was Deewaar, directed by Yash Chopra, where
            he worked with Shashi Kapoor, Nirupa Roy, Parveen Babi, and Neetu
            Singh, and earned another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The
            film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at
            number four.[53] Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25
            Must See Bollywood Films.[54] The other, released on 15 August 1975,
            was Sholay, which became the highest-grossing film ever in India at
            the time,[55] in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. Deewaar
            and Sholay are often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights
            of superstardom, two years after he became a star with Zanjeer, and
            consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s
            and 1980s.[56][57] In 1999, BBC India declared Sholay the "Film of
            the Millennium" and, like Deewaar, it has been cited by Indiatimes
            Movies as amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films.[54] In that
            same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it
            with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of
            50 Years. In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family
            drama Kabhie Kabhie. Bachchan starred as a young poet, Amit
            Malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named
            Pooja (Rakhee Gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (Shashi
            Kapoor). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic
            hero, a far cry from his "angry young man" roles like Zanjeer and
            Deewaar. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and
            audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best
            Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a
            double role in the hit Adalat as father and son. In 1977, he won his
            first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Amar Akbar
            Anthony, in which he played the third lead opposite Vinod Khanna and
            Rishi Kapoor as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing
            film of that year. His other successes that year include Parvarish
            and Khoon Pasina.[58] He once again resumed double roles in films
            such as Kasme Vaade (1978) as Amit and Shankar and Don (1978)
            playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and
            his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare
            Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash
            Chopra's Trishul and Prakash Mehra's Muqaddar Ka Sikandar both of
            which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is
            arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since
            all of his six releases the same year, namely Muqaddar Ka Sikandar,
            Trishul, Don, Kasme Vaade, Ganga Ki Saugandh and Besharam were
            massive successes, the former three being the consecutive
            highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a
            month of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema.[59][60] In 1979,
            Bachchan starred in Suhaag which was the highest earning film of
            that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and
            commercial success with films like Mr. Natwarlal, Kaala Patthar, The
            Great Gambler and Manzil. Amitabh was required to use his singing
            voice for the first time in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in
            which he starred with Rekha. Bachchan's performance in the film saw
            him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the
            Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer. He also received Best
            Actor nomination for Kaala Patthar and then went on to be nominated
            again in 1980 for the Raj Khosla directed film Dostana, in which he
            starred opposite Shatrughan Sinha and Zeenat Aman. Dostana proved to
            be the top-grossing film of 1980.[61] In 1981, he starred in Yash
            Chopra's melodrama film Silsila, where he starred alongside his wife
            Jaya and also Rekha. Other successful films of this period include
            Shaan (1980), Ram Balram (1980), Naseeb (1981), Lawaaris (1981),
            Kaalia (1981), Yaarana (1981), Barsaat Ki Ek Raat (1981) and Shakti
            (1982), also starring Dilip Kumar.[62][63] In 1982, he played double
            roles in the musical Satte Pe Satta and action drama Desh Premee
            which succeeded at the box office along with mega hits like action
            comedy Namak Halaal, action drama Khud-Daar and the critically
            acclaimed drama Bemisal.[64] In 1983, he played a triple role in
            Mahaan which was not as successful as his previous films.[65] Other
            releases during that year included Nastik and Pukar which were hits
            and Andha Kanoon (in which he had an extended guest appearance) was
            an average grosser.[62][verification needed] During a stint in
            politics from 1984 to 1987, his completed films Mard (1985) and
            Aakhree Raasta (1986) were released and were major hits.[66]
            Bachchan had played a role in a special appearance for the movie
            Kaun Jeeta Kaun Haara in the year 1987 and he sang a playback song
            with Kishore Kumar in this movie.[67] On 26 July 1982, while filming
            a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar for Coolie, Bachchan had
            near-fatal intestinal injury.[68] Bachchan was performing his own
            stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table
            and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the
            corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic
            rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He
            required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in
            hospital for many months, at times close to death. There were long
            queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was
            recuperating; the public response included prayers in temples and
            offers to sacrifice limbs to save him.[69] Nevertheless, he resumed
            filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The
            director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of Coolie: Bachchan's
            character was originally intended to have been killed off; but,
            after the change of script, the character lived in the end. Desai
            felt it would have been inappropriate for the man who had just
            fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. The footage of
            the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption
            appears onscreen marking it as the instant of the actor's
            injury.[70] The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the
            huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office
            success and the top-grossing film of that year.[71] Later, he was
            diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis. His illness made him feel weak
            both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and
            venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic,
            expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and
            stating before every release, "Yeh film to flop hogi!" ("This film
            will flop")

            In 2000, Bachchan hosted the first season of Kaun Banega Crorepati
            (KBC), the Indian adaptation of the British television game show,
            Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The show was well received.[122] A
            second season followed in 2005 but its run was cut short by Star
            Plus when Bachchan fell ill in 2006.[123] In 2009, Bachchan hosted
            the third season of the reality show Bigg Boss.[124] In 2010,
            Bachchan hosted the fourth season of KBC.[125] The fifth season
            started on 15 August 2011 and ended on 17 November 2011. The show
            became a massive hit with audiences and broke many TRP Records. CNN
            IBN awarded Indian of the Year- Entertainment to Team KBC and
            Bachchan. The Show also grabbed all the major Awards for its
            category.[126] The sixth season was also hosted by Bachchan,
            commencing on 7 September 2012, broadcast on Sony TV and received
            the highest number of viewers thus far.[citation needed] In 2014, he
