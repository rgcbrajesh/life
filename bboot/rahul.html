            <b>RAHUL GANDHI</b>
          </h4>
          <p>
            Rahul Gandhi (pronunciation (help·info) Hindustani pronunciation:
            [ˈraːɦʊl ˈɡaːn̪d̪ʱi]; born 19 June 1970) is an Indian politician and a
            member of the Indian Parliament, representing the constituency of
            Wayanad, Kerala in the 17th Lok Sabha. A member of the Indian
            National Congress, he served as the president of the Indian National
            Congress from 16 December 2017 to 3 July 2019. Gandhi is the
            chairperson of the Indian Youth Congress, the National Students
            Union of India also a trustee of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the
            Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. Born in New Delhi, Gandhi spent his
            early childhood between Delhi and Dehradun and stayed away from the
            public sphere for much of his childhood and early youth. He attained
            primary education in New Delhi and Dehradun but was later
            homeschooled because of security concerns. Gandhi began his
            undergraduate career at St. Stephen's College before moving to
            Harvard University. Gandhi transferred to Rollins College in Florida
            due to security threats following the assassination of his father,
            the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He graduated in 1994. The next
            year, Gandhi obtained his M.Phil. from Cambridge. Post-graduation,
            he began his professional career with the Monitor Group, a
            management consulting firm in London. He soon returned to India and
            established the Mumbai-based technology outsourcing firm, Backops
            Services Private Ltd. In 2004, Gandhi announced to enter active
            politics and successfully contested the general elections held that
            year from Amethi, a seat that was earlier held by his father; he won
            again from the constituency in 2009 and 2014. Amidst calls from
            Congress party veterans for his greater involvement in party
            politics and national government, Gandhi was elected Congress
            Vice-President in 2013, having served as the General Secretary
            previously. Gandhi led the Congress's campaign in the 2014 Indian
            general elections; the party suffered its worst electoral result in
            its history, winning only 44 seats compared to 206 seats won
            previously in the 2009 general election. In 2017, Gandhi succeeded
            his mother as Congress party leader and led the Congress into the
            2019 Indian general election. The Indian National Congress won 52
            seats, failing to get 10% of the seats needed to claim the post of
            Leader of Opposition. After this poor performan

          <p>
            Gandhi was born in Delhi on 19 June 1970,[1] as the first of the two
            children of Rajiv Gandhi, who later became the prime minister of
            India, and Italian-born Sonia Gandhi (née Maino), who later became
            the president of Indian National Congress, and as the grandson of
            Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. His paternal grandfather Feroze Gandhi
            was a Parsi from Gujarat.[2] He is also the great-grandson of
            India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Priyanka Vadra is
            his younger sister and Robert Vadra is his brother-in-law.[3] Gandhi
            attended St. Columba's School, Delhi[4] before entering the
            all-boys' boarding The Doon School in Dehradun (also the alma mater
            of his father, Rajiv Gandhi) from 1981 to 1983. Meanwhile, his
            father joined politics and became the prime minister on 31 October
            1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Due to the security
            threats faced by Indira Gandhi's family from Sikh extremists,
            Gandhi, and his sister, Priyanka was home-schooled thereafter.[5]
            Gandhi joined St. Stephen's College, Delhi (an affiliated college of
            the University of Delhi) in 1989 for his undergraduate education but
            moved to Harvard University after he completed the first year
            examinations.[6] In 1991, after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the
            Tamil Tigers (LTTE)[7] during an election rally, he shifted to
            Rollins College in Florida, USA, supposedly due to security concerns
            and obtained his B.A. in 1994.[8] During his time at Rollins, he
            assumed the pseudonym Raul Vinci and his identity was known only to
            the university officials and security agencies.[6][9] He further
            went on to obtain an M.Phil. from Trinity College, Cambridge in
            1995.[10] Before joining politics, Gandhi, worked at the Monitor
            Group, a management consulting firm, in London for three years.[11]
            In 2002, Gandhi returned to India and set up his technology
            consultancy viz. Backops Services Private Ltd in Mumbai, where he
            was one of the directors of the firm.[12] He then opened BackOps UK,
            a firm which used to acquire defence contracts from foreign
            companies that supplied to the Indian armed forces.[13] Subramanian
            Swamy pointed out that Rahul Gandhi declared himself as British
            citizen in the company's filings but the Congress party said that it
            was a yearly mistake.[14] Gandhi has been a strong proponent of
            harnessing the scale and dexterity that technology can lend while
            amplifying the power of citizens.

          <h4 id="list-item-3"><b> EARLY POLITICAL CAREER</b></h4>
          <p>
            <h3><b>Formative years</b></h3>
            In March 2004, Gandhi announced his entry into politics by announcing that he would contest the May 2004 elections, standing for his father's former constituency of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha, India's lower house of Parliament.[15] His mother had held the seat until she transferred to the neighboring seat of Raebareli. The Congress had been doing poorly in Uttar Pradesh, holding only 10 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state at the time.[16] At the time, this move generated surprise among political commentators, who had regarded his sister Priyanka Gandhi as being the more charismatic and likely to succeed. It generated speculation that the presence of a young member of India's most famous political family would reinvigorate the Congress party's political fortunes among India's youthful population[17] In his first interview with foreign media, Gandhi portrayed himself as an uniter of the country and condemned "divisive" politics in India, saying that he would try to reduce caste and religious tensions.[15] Gandhi won, retaining the family stronghold with a victory margin of over 100,000.[18] Until 2006, he held no other office.[19] Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka Gandhi managed their mother's campaign for re-election to Raebareilly in 2006, which was won with a victory margin of over 400,000 votes.[20] He was a prominent figure in the Congress campaign for the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections; Congress, however, won only 22 seats of the 403 seats with 8.53% of votes.[21]

Gandhi was appointed General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee on 24 September 2007 in a reshuffle of the party secretariat.[22] In the same reshuffle, he was also given charge of the Indian Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India.[23] In 2008, senior Congress leader Veerappa Moily mentioned "Rahul-as-PM" idea when the PM of India Manmohan Singh was still abroad.[24] He was elevated to the position of the vice-president of the party in January 2013.
<h3><b>Youth politics</b></h3> September 2007 when he was appointed general secretary in charge of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) and the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Gandhi promised to reform youth politics.[26] In his attempt to prove himself thus, in November 2008 Gandhi held interviews at his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in New Delhi to handpick at least 40 people who will make up the think-tank of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC), an organization that he has been keen to transform since he was appointed general secretary in September 2007.[27]

Under Gandhi, the IYC and NSUI have seen a dramatic increase in members from 200,000 to 2.5 million.[28] The Indian Express wrote in 2011, "Three years later, as another organizational reshuffle is in the offing, Gandhi's dream remains unrealized with party veterans manipulating internal elections in the Youth Congress and a host of people with questionable background gaining entry into it </h3>
<h3>General election (2009)</h3>  In the 2009 Indian general election, Gandhi retained his Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival by a margin of over 370,000 votes. Gandhi was credited with the Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh where they won 21 out of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats.[30][31] He spoke at 125 rallies across the country in six weeks.[32] The nationwide elections defied the predictions made by pre-poll predictions and exit polls and gave a clear mandate to the incumbent Congress-led UPA government.[33]

In May 2011, Gandhi was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police at Bhatta Parsaul village after he turned out in support of agitating farmers demanding more compensation for their land being acquired for a highway project. Gandhi was taken away from the protest site and later given bail and dropped off at the Delhi-UP border.
<h3>2012 Assembly elections</h3>   Gandhi campaigned during the 2012 Assembly elections in the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh election for almost two months, holding 200 rallies. However, Congress ranked as the fourth party in the state, winning 28 seats, an increase of six seats from the previous 2007 elections. Out of the 15 seats in the Amethi parliamentary constituency, Congress won two.[35][36]

Congress activists defended the result in Uttar Pradesh, saying "there's a big difference between state elections and national polls and in the end, there is only the first family, a hope and a prayer",[37] and pointing out the turn around attributed to Gandhi in the 2009 Lok Sabha national elections in the state. However, Gandhi publicly accepted responsibility for the result in an interview after the result was declared.[38]

In the Gujarat assembly elections held later in the year, Gandhi was not made the head of the election campaign. This was seen and regarded by opponents as an admission of defeat and was termed as a tactic to avoid the blame of defeat.[39][40][41] Congress won 57 seats in the assembly of 182, which was 2 less than the previous elections in 2007. Later in bypolls, Congress lost 4 more seats to BJP
<h3>General election (2014)</h3>   Gandhi contested the 2014 Indian general election from his constituency, Amethi,[43] and led the election campaign of the Indian National Congress.[44] Gandhi held the Amethi seat by defeating his nearest rival, BJP's Smriti Irani, by a reduced margin of 107,000 votes.[31][45] Under his leadership, the Indian National Congress suffered its worst-ever performance in elections and won only 44 seats compared to 206 seats won previously in the 2009 general election.[46][47] The Congress-led electoral alliance, the UPA also had its worst-ever performance in elections and won only 59 seats compared to 262 seats won previously in the 2009 general election.[47][48][49] After the defeat, Gandhi offered to resign his posts, only to be rejected by the party's working committee

          <p>
            Bharat Jodo Yatra, literally a ‘unite India march’ was started by Rahul Gandhi on September 7, 2022. Starting from Kanyakumari to reach Kashmir, the march covered 3,500 km in nearly five months across 12 States and two Union Territories.[63] During the march, the INC elected a new party president and also won a majority in the 2022 Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, its first majority it won by itself since 2018.
